     <p>While we were living in Holland it had been a dream of ours to own an island resort, and when we came to beautiful Pulau Kapas, we knew we had to build it here. Kapas Turtle Valley was built from the ground up by our own hands. We carefully planned and designed our resort to be the perfect getaway. We built the bungalows for comfort and relaxation, with the beach only a stone-throw away.
 The water here is crystal-clear and quite warm. The coral reef in front of our resort is a great spot for swimming, snorkeling, and diving. We often see turtles, rays, small reef sharks, and hundreds of different colorful fish. If you are adventurous, the island has a few jungle trekking trails that lead to quiet coves where you can even go cliff jumping.
 We treat each of our guests like family because we want you to feel at home while you are here wth us. We do our best to help you with anything you need, we cook with only the freshest ingredients, and our staff will make sure you don't have a single worry during your stay. 
 We look forward to meeting you and having you stay with us at Kapas Turtle Valley Beach Resort.
 Peter and Sylvia Engelbracht</p>
